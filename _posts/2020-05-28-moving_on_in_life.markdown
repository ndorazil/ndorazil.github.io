As is with many twenty year olds, I am looking for a way to support myself and find my purpose in life. It's funny that I am here now learning to become a software developer because I didn't even think I'd make it anywhere in life not too long ago. Let me provide a little bit of context. I promise, I'll keep it short...

Ever since I was a kid, I loved to ask questions like, "How does this work and why does it work like that?" Those are the questions that sparked my curiosity for technology and the internet. I wanted to know how all of it worked. I also started learning piano from a very young age, allowing me to develop a love for both technology and music growing up. It's what I'm known for by my family. I was around 11 or 12 years old when my dad helped me build my very first computer. I am still very proud of it and am, in fact, currently writing this post on it. It has a few different parts, but it's still the same one!

Back in May of 2017, I was diagnosed with Lyme disease. Some of you may have heard of it, and some of you probably haven't. Regardless if you know what it is, here is a list of what symptoms it causes: short term memory loss, depression, anxiety, swelling of joints, constant headaches and chronic fatigue. I had all of those things, and it really destroyed me during my sophomore year of high school, causing me to drop out.  I lost most of my friends and had almost no social life for quite a while. It truly sucked. This made it really difficult to do just about anything that required any amount of thinking.

Fast forward to now...

I have received LOTS of treatment for Lyme and have learned many ways to manage the issues that it causes. I created a whole new support system in my life. I also had to learn ways to remember information effectively and learn how to cope with all the other symptoms. But, it wasn't until last year that I finally got in the mindset of "If I want to do something, I'll make it happen." I decided that I didn't want to do JUST music, I also wanted to pursue software development, both of the things I love.

It is said that if you love what you do, you never work a day in your life. That, my friends, is why I am here today. I am pursuing both of the things I love. Heck, I can even combine both of these and create software FOR music! I'm finally able to move on from my past. I know that this will be a tough journey to becoming a software developer, but it will also be a very rewarding one.
